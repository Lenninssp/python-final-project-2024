## Main Idea

Project Description: Pokémon-Themed Game of Life

This project is a modern reimagining of John Conway’s 1970 “Game of Life,” integrated with the Pokémon universe. Using Python with Flask for the backend and React with Next.js for the frontend, the game will be accessible through a web browser. Instead of the traditional Game of Life’s random cells, each cell in this version will represent a unique Pokémon, using data from the official Pokémon API.

Key Features:

    1.	Pokémon Integration:
    •	Each cell in the game grid will represent a different Pokémon, with its stats (e.g., attack, defense, speed) affecting the gameplay.
    •	The game dynamically pulls data from the Pokémon API to fill the grid.
    2.	User-Selected Pokémon:
    •	Users can choose their first Pokémon to start the game with, personalizing the experience.
    •	Pokémon will evolve based on game mechanics, influenced by the rules of Conway’s Game of Life.
    3.	Difficulty Settings:
    •	Players can select different difficulty levels, which could impact the behavior of Pokémon, grid size, or game speed.
    4.	Game Mechanics:
    •	While maintaining the core rules of Conway’s Game of Life (birth, survival, and death), Pokémon attributes will influence the evolution of cells. Stronger Pokémon may survive longer or have different effects on their neighbors.
    5.	Accessible Web Interface:
    •	The game will be fully accessible via a web interface, where users can play, interact with the grid, and observe the evolving Pokémon ecosystem in real-time.

## Technologies

This project combines Python’s Flask for backend logic, managing the API connection, and React with Next.js for the dynamic frontend, delivering a rich, interactive experience for users.
